# Sentiment-Analysis-Pipeline
## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an NLP-based sentiment analysis pipeline designed to extract public sentiment from X (fka Twitter) about specific stocks or the market as a whole.

The objective is to build an end-to-end, cloud-native MLOps pipeline capable of performing real-time sentiment analysis on tweets. By leveraging fine-tuned LLMs such as BERT and GPT, the model aims to integrate sentiment insights with stock market trends to predict short-term market performance effectively.
