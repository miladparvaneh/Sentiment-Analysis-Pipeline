# Sentiment-Analysis-Pipeline
## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an NLP-based sentiment analysis system designed to extract public sentiment from X (formerly Twitter) about specific stocks or the market as a whole. The objective is to build an end-to-end, cloud-native MLOps pipeline capable of performing real-time sentiment analysis on tweets. By leveraging fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) such as BERT and GPT, the system aims to integrate sentiment insights with stock market trends to predict market performance effectively.
