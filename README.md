# Sentiment-Analysis-Pipeline
## Project Overview
In this project, I will build an NLP-based sentiment analysis model to extract public sentiment from Twitter related to specific stocks or the market in general. I will then use this sentiment, along with other features such as tweet volume and time of day, to predict short-term stock market movements.
